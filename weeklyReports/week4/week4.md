**What is the right to repair movement and why does it matter?**
<br>
The right to repair is the movement that pretends create awareness to electronics consumers about their right to repair their electronic products using the schematics of a product if provided. Many companies are now omitting the inclusion of these schematics in their products and customers feel forced to them back to the place they bought it from. Aside from this previous mentioned issue, some of this companies are taking advantage by increasing the prices of the services on these products, making it even more hard on customers. 

This issue matters to us because it helps bring the community together with a common goal to stop other possible companies from doing the same thing. Also, it helps take the proper political measurements to try to get a solution to the existing entities that are practicing this "selfish monopoly"
